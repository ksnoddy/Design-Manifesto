## Introduction 
Hello! My name is Ken Snoddy and I am currently a Junior at Worcester Polyetechnic Institute majoring in Management Information Systems with a minor in Computer Science and Data Science. 
My current interests include managing big data, and overall utlizing my skillsets in a vast majority of ways. 
Some fun facts are that I am half Japanese, and fluent in Japanese. 
I go to Japan every summer to visit relatives and also attended school in Japan. 
In this design document, I will be explaining my main takeaways along with my own portfolio of projects from the Human Computer Interaction Course (CS 3041) here at WPI.

## Projects
- **Good Design / Bad Design**
    - This assignment had us find what we think are good deisigns and bad designs on the WPI website. For my design document, I chose to  write on WPI's Global Portal. With plentiful opportunities for students to study abroad, the global portal is a great way for    students to explore IQP and MQP sites. However, the current global portal for Juniors is very difficult to use. In addition to the harsh color scheme, the global portal is difficult to use compared to the Global Portal 2.0. The new global poprtal separates the project sites from on-campus anbd off-campus sites, while also providing a visually appealing and easy to use UI. From this assignment, I was able to start training myself on the overall design of things and the user interface that it provides for the user.

- **Design for Others**
    - This assignment made us redesign a webpage to a specifically assigned demographic. In this project, my group decided to redesign the Technocopia webpage to meet the needs of K12 teachers serving the Worcester Public Schools District. We redesigned the overall  webpage to be more user friendly to teachers, having a easier way to engage their students in the Technocopia makerspace in  Worcester. We first created a paper prototype to understand the visual look of our design, as well as how the user will move around once on the webpage. For our final prototype, we redesigned the pages in Photoshop, and then used Invision to create the flow from one page to another on a mobile device. This assignment allowed me to understand the importance of visual designs and paper prototypes as it is very helpful when mapping out your design.

- **Design for Understanding**
    - For this assignment, we were assigned to use two different visual communication techniques to present the same data set. In my group of four, we split up into two where we analyzed employment after graduation by major through clear communication and reasoning and persuasive communication and storytelling. My partner and I analyzed the data to present it in three different ways that portrayed a clear portrait of the data for the user. We used Vega-Lite to create three separate graphs that showed three different columns of data taken from the data set. After participating in some user testing, I was able to experience visualizing data in both a clear and communicative way and a persuasive way. I believe that this is important as data can be easily understandable for some users over the other. Therefore, it is important to either specialize your data presentations into separate categories based on your users or have a good balance for presenting data visually.
